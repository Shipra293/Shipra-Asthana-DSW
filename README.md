LOAN APPROVAL PREDICTION
This repository contains a project for predicting loan approvals based on customer data. The project involves Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover insights and relationships within the data and the implementation of three machine learning models: Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and AdaBoost. The model with the highest accuracy is selected for deployment.
Data preprocessing: Handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and scale numerical features.
Exploratory Data Analysis: Identify patterns and relationships in the dataset.
Model training: Train three models (Random Forest, Logistic Regression, AdaBoost).
Model evaluation: Compare model performance metrics.
Model selection: Select the model with the highest accuracy.
